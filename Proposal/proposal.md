# Cornerstone of global communication: Vulnerabilities of the international submarine telecommunication cable

## Research objectives and research question
### Research question
Which part of world and its internet services capacity are more vulnerable to the fibre optic submarine telecommunication cable(STC) failure.

### Research objectives
1. To review the functionality and the importance of the STC in the global internet services, justify its development in the past and future project
2. Analysis of in-services STC market, include but not limited to its spatial distribution and services capacity
3. Case study of the 2022 South pacific ocean Tonga Domestic Cable Extension(TDCE) breaks down. Determine the STC which are likely to be affected by the disruption events. 
4. Analysis of the optimal route and identify the availability and cost of the alternative route by considering the internet traffic. 
5. Potential new STC to improve the robustness of the internet services




## Background / Preliminary Literature Review
### Background
As the progress of the information technology on mobile devices combined with the raise of the 5G technology and cloud computing services, the demand on the higher stand internet services can be foreseen. World need a media to transmit big amount of data inexpensively in the long range. As the "high way" of the data communication, the optic fibre is the most common tool for wired long-distance data communication.(Kangovi, 2017) There are two types of state level fiber optic cables: fibre optic terrestrial telecommunication cable(TTC) and fibre optic submarine telecommunication cable(STC), in terms of useability latter one gains bigger market share. Nowadays STC is responsible for more than 98% of the global internet transmission (Winseck, 2017) with the total length of 1.2 million KM of STC were constructed. (Wang et al., 2019). In some terms, any internet communication is dependent on the functional working of STC in the field like: academia, education, entertainment, finance, medication and military. Considering the irreplaceability of STC in all aspect of the people's daily life, the failure could cause significant negative impact on the social and economic disruptions on a community or society. 

The failure of a STC might not give inaccessability of the worldwide internet, as the nature the internet routing topology(Calvert, Doar and Zegura, 1997) suggested that connection can still be established by a long and less table connection.(Turner et al., 2010b). But it is not true for all the countries. In 2008 either SEA-ME-WE 4 or FLAG was damaged by a dragging ship anchor, the internet automatically reroute date to SEA-ME-WE 3 and overwhelmed its design capacity which subsequently caused more than 50% of internet services interruption in middle-east area. (Zetter, 2008) Fore recently, in 2022 the volcano eruption in Tonga cause the failure on Tonga's only STC and the nation lost almost all the communication with rest of the world for 5 weeks.(Bateman, 2022) Due to the commercial interest and limit in internet usage, usually less developed countries and remote island such as Chile or Marshall island do not have an alternative STC for redundancy.(Dominey-Howes, 2022) Obversely these countries are more dependent and suffers more losses if the STC breaks down. 
    
Even STC is a world spread infrastructure, there are still 4 billions of people do not have access to internet, the satellite internet can be an alternative technology to replace the STC by using the non-synchronous orbit satellite.(Graydon and Parks, 2019) These satellite rotates around the earth obit, providing wireless internet connection to the customer near the earth surface. If the satellite is located in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), user will suffer from the high latency and limited bandwidth, whereas the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can significant mitigate this issue but LEO acquires hundreds of thousands satellites to provide worldwide coverage which gives higher standards on the internet services provider(ISP).(Deutschmann et al., 2021) The satellite internet services always have higher requirements on the user budget, as the extra devices and expensive data package need to be pre-purchased before the usage.(starlink, 2022)

### Literature Review

The term Critical infrastructure is defined by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction(USDRR) as _"The physical structures, facilities, networks and other assets which provide services that are essential to the social and economic functioning of a community or society."_(USDRR, 2022) To the importance of the STC, in 1998 US Presidential directive PDD-63 which also known as Critical infrastructure protection(CIP) was signed aims to protect the _"the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof."_(McCue, 2015) As the most backbone of the transoceanic network communication, STC is ineluctably one of the item within.

In contrast to the importance of the STC in the real world, the research attention on the STC vulnerabilities remains limited. Author adopts 3 relative field of literature: STC's protection, Factors lead of the STC failure, STC routing elasticity

#### Relative research on STC's protection


#### Relative research on the factors lead of STC failure


#### Relative research on STC routing elasticity
