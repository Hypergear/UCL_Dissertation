# Cornerstone of global communication: Vulnerabilities of the international submarine telecommunication cable

## Research objectives and research question

### Research question
Which part of world and its internet services capacity are more vulnerable to the fibre optic submarine telecommunication cable(STC) failure.

### Research objectives
1. To review the functionality and the importance of the STC in the global internet services, justify its development in the past and future project
2. Analysis of in-services STC market, include but not limited to its spatial distribution and services capacity
3. Case study of the 2022 South pacific ocean Tonga Domestic Cable Extension(TDCE) breaks down. Determine the STC which are likely to be affected by the disruption events. 
4. Analysis of the optimal route and identify the availability and cost of the alternative route by considering the internet traffic. 
5. Potential new STC to improve the robustness of the internet services
