## Background / Preliminary Literature Review
### Background
As the progress of the information technology on mobile devices combined with the raise of the 5G technology and cloud computing services, the demand on the higher stand internet services can be foreseen. World need a media to transmit big amount of data inexpensively in the long range. As the "high way" of the data communication, the optic fibre is the most common tool for wired long-distance data communication.(Kangovi, 2017) There are two types of state level fiber optic cables: fibre optic terrestrial telecommunication cable(TTC) and fibre optic submarine telecommunication cable(STC), in terms of useability latter one gains bigger market share. Nowadays STC is responsible for more than 98% of the global internet transmission (Winseck, 2017) with the total length of 1.2 million KM of STC were constructed. (Wang et al., 2019). In some terms, any internet communication is dependent on the functional working of STC in the field like: academia, education, entertainment, finance, medication and military. Considering the irreplaceability of STC in all aspect of the people's daily life, the failure could cause significant negative impact on the social and economic disruptions on a community or society. 

The failure of a STC might not give inaccessability of the worldwide internet, as the nature the internet routing topology(Calvert, Doar and Zegura, 1997) suggested that connection can still be established by a long and less table connection.(Turner et al., 2010b). But it is not true for all the countries. In 2008 either SEA-ME-WE 4 or FLAG was damaged by a dragging ship anchor, the internet automatically reroute date to SEA-ME-WE 3 and overwhelmed its design capacity which subsequently caused more than 50% of internet services interruption in middle-east area. (Zetter, 2008) Fore recently, in 2022 the volcano eruption in Tonga cause the failure on Tonga's only STC and the nation lost almost all the communication with rest of the world for 5 weeks.(Bateman, 2022) Due to the commercial interest and limit in internet usage, usually less developed countries and remote island such as Chile or Marshall island do not have an alternative STC for redundancy.(Dominey-Howes, 2022) Obversely these countries are more dependent and suffers more losses if the STC breaks down. 
    
Even STC is a world spread infrastructure, there are still 4 billions of people do not have access to internet, the satellite internet can be an alternative technology to replace the STC by using the non-synchronous orbit satellite.(Graydon and Parks, 2019) These satellite rotates around the earth obit, providing wireless internet connection to the customer near the earth surface. If the satellite is located in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), user will suffer from the high latency and limited bandwidth, whereas the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can significant mitigate this issue but LEO acquires hundreds of thousands satellites to provide worldwide coverage which gives higher standards on the internet services provider(ISP).(Deutschmann et al., 2021) The satellite internet services always have higher requirements on the user budget, as the extra devices and expensive data package need to be pre-purchased before the usage.(starlink, 2022)

### Literature Review

The term Critical infrastructure is defined by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction(USDRR) as _"The physical structures, facilities, networks and other assets which provide services that are essential to the social and economic functioning of a community or society."_(USDRR, 2022) To the importance of the STC, in 1998 US Presidential directive PDD-63 which also known as Critical infrastructure protection(CIP) was signed aims to protect the _"the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof."_(McCue, 2015) As the most backbone of the network communication, STC is ineluctably to be one of the item within.

In contrast to the importance of the STC in the real world, the research attention on the STC vulnerabilities remains limited. Author adopts 3 relative field of literature: technical factors lead of the STC failure, regulations and international law applied to STC, human destruction and espionage


#### Technical factors lead of the STC failure

To identify the real world challenges STC face, some intersected content between this section and destruction and espionage. But this section focus on the human accidental damages and the damages caused by the nature disaster.

Considering the cost of assembly and the importance of the network connectivity, the STC is designed to achieve high reliability of 25 years service life without any maintenance.(Worthington, 1984) STC are laid on the seabed where the depth could reach up to 8000m which is under the condition of high water pressure, rough rocks combined with marine corrosion to the STC's protection layer.(Laque, 1975)(Beaufils, 2000) 

To protect fragile fibre twist pair within the STC, STC is installed with 5 different classes of protection to overcome the different working conditions and balance the budget.(Al-Lawati, 2015)(ZTT, 2019)(Libert and Waterworth, 2016)
* Light Weight(LW):
This cable is the basic unit of the STC equips with the minimum protection which only designed with a stainless steel tube with fibers and a layer of polyethylene (PE) extrusion outside for protection. It is only used for depth of 8km below the sea because very few human interfere and potential animal damage could reach such depth. 
* Light Weight Protected(LWP):
During the deployment, the crew will try to avoid seamount which could cause the cable to chafe again the seabed. But in some region the steep terrain can not be avoided dut to the congestion or budget on the cable length. In addition to LW, LWP provides extra protection with a layer of steel tape and insulation which is more robust to resist to abrasion LW before failure. Another reason why engineer uses LWP is the shark, some research suggested that the visible vibration or the acoustic vibration generated by the cable attracts the attention of the shark from "fish bitting".(Eichengreen, Lafarguette and Mehl, 2016)
* Single Armor(SA): 
SA equips a 3 to 3.5mm diameter single layer of high strength galvanized armor outside of the LW can be deployed to 2000m depth which is also the maximum depth for fishing equipments. Buried into the seabed in required to prevent the external damage from human or other fish from bitting.
* Double Armor (DA):
In addition to SA, DA is protected by a second layer of high strength galvanized armor which makes the cable stiffer to the damage. The DA is suitable for shallow water within 500m depth where the region that can not be buried under the seabed such as rocky outcrops, animal habitat or fishing harbor. In some places, DA is also the alternative solution to th SA due to the harsh environmental conditions or the cost for the burial. 
* Rock Armor (RA):
When the STC reaches very shallowed water zone(less than 50m depth) or near the coastline where intensive of external aggression could apply to the STC, RA should be used. Moreover, more than 90% of marine life lives in the photic zone(Peck, 2018) and the erosion of sharp broken rocks by turbulent flow(Liu et al., 2015) are on the same layer of the ocean with RA.


The world submarine network did not experience global disruptions thanks to the network rerouting, increasing supply on the cable ships(A specialized ship to install and repair the STC) and fast growing cable breakdown detection technology in the recent decades(Inc, 2020)

There are about 150-200 STC failure cases annually, the marine activities such as fishing dredge and anchoring are the two major accidents causing the damage on the STC, around 72% of failure were directly caused by these.(Kordahi, Stix and Rapp, 2016) Further more than that, the failure caused by fishing and anchoring are more likely to happen in the shallow water, the chance decreases as the water gets deeper(Mamatsopoulos et al., 2020) The fishing dredge is towed alone the seabed to harvest the species in at the bottom of the ocean, this action can directly cause damage on unburied STC(Carter, 2010, p.64) There are two types of damage on STC when anchoring, usually damage caused by dragging occurs more frequently than impact(Zheng et al., 2022)

Figure 1. Impact and drag damage on STC by anchoring(Zheng et al., 2022)

Earthquakes, volcanic eruption, tsunami and submarine landslides are believed to be the significant non-human hazard for STC(Pope, Talling and Carter, 2017) The volcanic eruptions damages the STC by lava flow and hot rock fragments(McDonald et al., 2017). Earthquakes can cause significant movement of the sediments which subsequently triggers the landsides on the seabed.(Pope, Talling and Carter, 2017) In some cases, the volcano eruption is the origin of the tsunami and submarine earthquake(Latter, 1981) which increased the chance of the STC failure.

#### Regulations and international law applied to STC

As the nature of STC provides the transnational communication, the STC usually connects multiple countries even different continents, which makes complicates the jurisdiction.

#### Destruction and espionage
