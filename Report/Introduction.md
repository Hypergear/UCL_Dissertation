## Abstract
With the rise of global internet connectivity and the increasing availability of inexpensive computer devices. The submarine telecommunication cable(STC) plays as the backbone infrastructure to carry the data traffic in the international information transmission. However, STC is extremely vulnerable to damages such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. If the damage is taken, the repairing may need a few months before the finish and this would directly cause the bandwidth detrition or lagging to the internet services. To understand this question, this article models the global STC under a topological network structure to identify the high risk area. As the result, 88 STC vulnerable countries and an uneven distribution of network dependency can be located. For a given STC topology, we proposed a method to improve and analysis its topological robustness. These findings may provide some inspiration to the industry and politicians to revisit the importance and current protection measurements on the STC system.

## Introduction
As the progress of the information technology on mobile devices combined with the rise of the 5G technology and cloud computing services, the demand for the higher stand internet services can be foreseen. The world needs a medium to transmit large amount of data inexpensively more than ever. As the _high way_ of data communication, the optic fibre is the most common tool for wired long-distance data communication.(@kangovi_2017_3) There are two types of state level fiber optic cables: fibre optic terrestrial telecommunication cable(TTC) and fibre optic submarine telecommunication cable(STC). In terms of useability, the latter gains a bigger market share. (@marra_2018_ultrastable) Nowadays, STC is responsible for more than 98% of global internet transmission.(@winseck_2017_the) By estimate, more than 1.2 million KM of STC were constructed since 1990. (Wang et al., 2019). In some terms, any internet service benefitted from STC's functional working in fields such as academia, education, entertainment, finance, medication, and the military. Considering the irreplaceability of STC in all aspects of people's daily life, the failure could cause a significant negative impact on the social and economical disruptions in a community or society. 

The failure of an STC might not give inaccessibility of the worldwide internet, as the nature of the internet routing topology, (@calvert_1997_modeling) suggested that the connection can still be obtained by a longer and less stable connection. (@turner_2010_california). However, it is not true for all the countries. In 2008 a dragging ship anchor damaged either SEA-ME-WE 4 or FLAG, the internet automatically rerouted the data to SEA-ME-WE 3 and overwhelmed its design capacity, which subsequently caused more than 50% of internet services interruption in middle-east area. (@zetter_2008_undersea) More recently, in 2022 the volcano eruption in Tonga caused the failure to Tonga's only STC, which subsequently lead to the internet blackout with the rest of the world for nearly five weeks.(@bateman_2022_cut) Due to the commercial interest and limited internet usage, usually less developed countries and remote islands such as Chile or Marshall island do not have an alternative STC for redundancy. (@domineyhowes_2022_when) Obviously these countries are more dependent and suffer more losses if the STC breaks down. 

To approach STC vulnerabilities, author divided this paper into six sections. The next section describes some overviews of the related work. Subsequently, we proceed with the data section where source datasets and data scope are presented. The Section 4 presents the core definitions and necessary analysis tools for quantitative development. While Section 5 exposes author's strategical findings and resulting estimations. The paper finishes with a Section 5 and Section 6 with a finding discussion and study conclusion.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the different system architectures for the three systems conceived by Telesat, OneWeb and SpaceX; Section 3 introduces the methodology to estimate the total system capacity and derive the requirements for the ground segment.; Section 4 presents the results in terms of total system throughput and number of gateway and ground station locations required by each of the mega-constellations; Section 5 identifies the major technical challenges that we believe these systems still have to overcome before becoming operational; and Section 6 presents our overall conclusions.
