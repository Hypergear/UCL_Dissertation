## Abstract
With the rise of global internet connectivity and the increasing availability of inexpensive computer devices. The submarine telecommunication cable(STC) plays as the backbone infrastructure to carry the data traffic in the international information transmission. However, STC is extremely vulnerable to damages such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. If the damage is taken, the repairing may need a few months before the finish and this would directly cause the bandwidth detrition or lagging to the internet services. To understand this question, this article models the global STC under a topological network structure to identify the high risk area. As the result, 88 STC vulnerable countries and an uneven distribution of network dependency can be located. For a given STC topology, we proposed a method to improve and analysis its topological robustness. These findings may provide some inspiration to the industry and politicians to revisit the importance and current protection measurements on the STC system.

## Introduction
As the progress of the information technology on mobile devices combined with the rise of the 5G technology and cloud computing services, the demand for the higher stand internet services can be foreseen. The world needs a medium to transmit large amount of data inexpensively more than ever. As the _high way_ of data communication, the optic fibre is the most common tool for wired long-distance data communication.(@kangovi_2017_3) There are two types of state level fiber optic cables: fibre optic terrestrial telecommunication cable(TTC) and fibre optic submarine telecommunication cable(STC). In terms of useability, the latter gains a bigger market share. (@marra_2018_ultrastable) Nowadays, STC is responsible for more than 98% of global internet transmission (@winseck_2017_the). By estimate, more than 1.2 million KM of STC were constructed. (Wang et al., 2019). In some terms, any internet service depends on STC's functional working in fields such as  academia, education, entertainment, finance, medication, and the military. Considering the irreplaceability of STC in all aspects of people's daily life, the failure could cause a significant negative impact on the social and economical disruptions in a community or society. 

The failure of an STC might not give inaccessibility of the worldwide internet, as the nature of the internet routing topology, (@calvert_1997_modeling) suggested that the connection can still be obtained by a longer and less stable connection. (@turner_2010_california). However, it is not true for all the countries. In 2008 a dragging ship anchor damaged either SEA-ME-WE 4 or FLAG, the internet automatically rerouted the data to SEA-ME-WE 3 and overwhelmed its design capacity, which subsequently caused more than 50% of internet services interruption in middle-east area. (@zetter_2008_undersea) More recently, in 2022 the volcano eruption in Tonga caused the failure to Tonga's only STC, which subsequently lead to the internet blackout with the rest of the world for nearly five weeks.(@bateman_2022_cut) Due to the commercial interest and limited internet usage, usually less developed countries and remote islands such as Chile or Marshall island do not have an alternative STC for redundancy. (@domineyhowes_2022_when) Obviously these countries are more dependent and suffer more losses if the STC breaks down. 
    
Even STC is a world spread infrastructure, there are still four billion people who do not have access to the internet. However, satellite internet can be an alternative technology to replace the STC by using the non-synchronous orbit satellites. (@graydon_2019_connecting) These satellites rotate around the earth obit, providing wireless internet connection to the customer near the earth's surface. If the satellite is located in geostationary earth orbit, the user will suffer from the high latency and limited bandwidth. The low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can significantly mitigate these issues, but LEO acquires hundreds of thousands of satellites to provide worldwide coverage which gives higher standards on the internet services provider(ISP). (@deutschmann_2021_broadband) Regardless, satellite internet services always have higher requirements on the user budget than STC, as the professional technical devices and expensive data packages need to be pre-purchased before usage.
