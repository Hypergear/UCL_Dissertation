## Discussion

This paper compared the topological structure of the STC and analyzed its vulnerability at the country level and route level. This section aims to comment on the findings and reflect on the limitations due to the real-world implications.

Firstly, the country level network consists of a wider range of areas by averaging the geographical differences and accessibility to the cable repair resources, for instance, different water conditions measurements, waterway and no-shipping zone, rich and poor countries. A more explicit analysis would help to clarify the damage results. Secondary, landlocked states are not included in this study, this was partly because of the lack of construction data in TLC. Consequently, landlocked states connect to the global STC network via data forwarding from adjacent coastal states via the TLC. Thirdly, the bandwidth for every STC is not publicly available, the estimation was based on the cable length, year of construction, budget cost and the existing cables in the nearby water. The actual capacity is less than estimation since the most cited metrics are potential capacity(max possible bandwidth) rather than lit capacity(actual running bandwidth).

As the focus on the topological structure of the STC network. 
Testing with different results of the shortest-path analysis from UK to China and global betweenness centrality analysis using different distance measures to simulate the assortment of focus on the routing strategies. The shortest path finding only reveals some meteoritical path taken, as the routers also need to consider the instantaneous availability of the cables and pre-defined rules in the routing table. The overlap in a handful of landing stations with the high value of betweenness centrality also suggests the potential risk of workload overwhelming on the popular landing stations when they are chosen by multiple routing policies simultaneously.

However, STC failure could also be dependent on varieties of geographical situations. Correspondingly high volumes of fishing, cargo shipping, water saltiness, earth tectonic hazard frequency. This study was motivated by the analysis of the route pattern in the real-world distribution when the weakness of STC was targeted, the identification of adjustments for the quality infrastructure setup through avoidance of the missing connections. Yet, these arguments do not go far enough.

To overcome the vulnerability, redundancy is not the only available option to fill the missing capacity due to the absence of a primary cable. Instead, redundant cables are especially weak against human-led destructions. States can influence the cable deploying companies with a more frequent cable status patrol or by adding prevent cautions such as setting up cable protection zones to prevent the damage from fishing dredge or anchoring. While these precautions do not exclude the risk of natural hazards. Avoiding the seismic, volcanic, and landslide zone on the cable path is meaningful to prevent the destruction from the geologic activities before laying the cables. Thus the open communication and negotiation between ISP and cable operators before the proper deployment helps to reduce the uncertainty of the network stability.

Another aspect that also needs to be considered to better understand the vulnerability is the countermeasures in the internet backbone landing stations against the major events such as the unexpected hostile attacks on infrastructure or internet blackouts due to the natural hazard. Moreover, the dependency on energy infrastructure and cascading effects on the bandwidth deteriorates in the nearby states combined with the side effect on other internet-dependent businesses such as government administration, banking services and other digital services leading to a higher requirement for the cable and relative infrastructure protection. 
Additionally, developing emergency planning and keeping the open communication with the damage control crew with and in-hand repair tools(material, vessels). Moreover, the satellite internet communication devices would also help to enhance the robustness against STC failure. In view of this, keeping installing the redundant cables and utilizing satellite internet services as the backup technology by driving the diversification of the broadband access entrance can be considered a bright side to the global internet connectivity resilience.

## Conclusion

The submarine telecommunication cable network is an essential infrastructure that urgently needs to be protected, but academia and international legislation should not dismiss the negative impacts of the social and economical tensions, especially when the intentional attack(eg military and terrorist) can be achieved very easily. 

This paper modelled the global STC network and analyzed the topological vulnerabilities from 2 arguments(cable, landing station) in 2 visibility levels(country, local) as the mean of assessing the robustness of the alternative cables when the primary fails. 

The study firstly analysis all the states(n=183) with STC connections, the broadband threshold of internet shortage in the next few years remains low, but around 48% of the countries are formed in the most vulnerable class. The most vulnerable states must improve their telecommunication infrastructure quality to minimize the probability of internet blackout at the state level. Also, a further territorial investigation shows the high dependency on a handful of key landing stations on international internet connectivity. In addition, we also compared the impact of emerging internet services infrastructure(star-link), their usage as the emergency substitute might back the additional connectivity. From the standpoint of cable shortage in internet vulnerable countries and increasing participation of international tech giants recently, the future research will also take into consideration of larger international geopolitical contestations.

As the data communication plays the crucial role in the more than ever, the importance and vulnerability of the STC should seriously be recognized by relative expert from marine environmentalists to geopolitics.
