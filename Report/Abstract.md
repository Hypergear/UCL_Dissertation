# Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}

With the rise of global internet connectivity and the increasing
availability of inexpensive computer devices. The submarine
telecommunication cable(STC) plays as the backbone infrastructure to
carry the data traffic in the international information transmission.
However, STC is extremely vulnerable to damages such as natural
disasters and terrorist attacks. If the damage is taken, the repairing
may need a few months before the finish and this would directly cause
the bandwidth detrition or lagging to the internet services. To
understand this question, this article models the global STC under a
topological network structure to identify the high risk area. As the
result, 88 STC vulnerable countries and an uneven distribution of
network dependency can be located. For a given STC topology, we proposed
a method to improve and analysis its topological robustness. These
findings may provide some inspiration to the industry and politicians to
revisit the importance and current protection measurements on the STC
system.\
